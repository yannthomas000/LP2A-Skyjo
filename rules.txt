----------------------** THE RULES OF SKYJO **----------------------------

- Skyjo is played with a deck of 150 cards numbered from -2 to 12.
  We gave each value the name of a UTBM professor (ex: "Girardot (-2)" )
  DISCLAIMER : Our ranking is subjective and is solely our responsibility !

- The game can be played with 2 to 8 players.

---------------------** BEGINNING OF THE GAME**---------------------------

- Each player is dealt 12 cards, which are placed face down in front
  of them. 4 column of 3.

- Each player reveals two cards of their choice face up. The player with
  the highest sum of the two cards starts the round.

--------------------------** THE GAME **---------------------------------------

- The objective of the game is to have the lowest score possible at
  the end of the game.

- On each turn, players can either exchange one of their cards with the
  visible card on the table from the discard pile or draw a card from the draw pile.

- SPECIAL RULE : If a player reveals or places 3 identical cards in a column,
  then the player gets rid of these 3 cards! (by placing them in the discard pile)

- A player end the game when all their cards are visible. The other
  players then have one more turn to play.

----------------------------** ENDING **-----------------------------------------

- Points are counted at the end of the game by adding up the value of
  the cards

- If the player who finished the round first did not obtain the
  lowest score in that round, then the sum of their points for that round is doubled.

- At the end of each round, the points of each player are added to the total
  score obtained in previous rounds.

- The game ends as soon as a player reaches 100 points or more. 
  The player with the lowest score wins the game
